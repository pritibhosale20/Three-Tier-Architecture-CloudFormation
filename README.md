## Three-Tier Architecture Deployment using AWS CloudFormation

## Overview

This project provisions a Three-Tier Architecture on AWS using CloudFormation. The architecture consists of:

Web Tier: Nginx Web Server (EC2) behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

App Tier: Flask API Server (EC2) for backend logic

Database Tier: Amazon RDS (MySQL) for data storage

## Architecture Components

**VPC & Networking:**

A VPC with multiple subnets across two Availability Zones for high availability.

Public subnets for ALB & WebServer (Nginx).

Private subnets for AppServer (Flask API) and Database (RDS).

**Security Groups:**

ALBSecurityGroup: Allows HTTP (80) from the internet and forwards to WebServer.

WebSecurityGroup: Allows HTTP (80) only from ALB and forwards to AppServer.

AppSecurityGroup: Allows requests only from WebServer on port 5000.

DBSecurityGroup: Allows only AppServer to connect to RDS on port 3306.

**Load Balancer:**

An Application Load Balancer (ALB) in public subnets.

Routes incoming HTTP traffic to the WebServer.

**EC2 Instances:**

WebServer (Nginx) handles frontend requests.

AppServer (Flask API) handles backend logic.

**Database Layer:**

Amazon RDS (MariaDB) for persistent data storage.

Deployed in private subnets for security.

## Deployment Instructions

**1️⃣ Launch CloudFormation Stack**

Navigate to AWS Management Console → CloudFormation.

Click on Create Stack → With new resources.

Upload the CloudFormation YAML template.

Click Create Stack and wait for deployment completion.

**2️⃣ Verify the Deployment**

Go to EC2 Dashboard and verify:

WebServer and AppServer instances are running.

Go to RDS Dashboard and check:

The database instance is active.

Go to Load Balancer Section in EC2 and verify:

The ALB is active and associated with EC2 instances.

Check Security Groups to confirm:

ALB allows inbound HTTP (80) traffic.

WebServer allows traffic only from ALB.

AppServer allows traffic only from WebServer.

RDS allows connections only from AppServer.

**3️⃣ Test the Application**

Get ALB DNS Name:

Navigate to EC2 → Load Balancers.

Copy the ALB DNS Name from the output section.

Open in Browser:

Visit http://<ALB_DNS_Name> to check the frontend (WebServer).

The request should be forwarded to the backend (AppServer).

The backend should interact with the database (RDS).

**Manual Changes Required**

Update the AMI ID for EC2 instances based on the region.

Modify Key Pair Name for SSH access.

Adjust Instance Types as per your requirements.

Ensure RDS username & password are correctly configured.

**Cleanup**

To delete all resources, simply delete the CloudFormation Stack:

Go to CloudFormation → Stacks.

Select your stack and click Delete.

Wait for AWS to remove all resources automatically.
